        <p id="para">Austen sold the copyright of Pride and Prejudice to Thomas Egerton for Â£110, a decision that proved costly as the novel's success generated significant profits for the publisher. Egerton published the first edition in three volumes in January 1813, with subsequent editions in 1813 and 1817. The novel was translated into various languages and published in the United States in August 1832.</p>
        <p id="para">Originally published anonymously, Pride and Prejudice was attributed to "the Author of Sense and Sensibility," establishing Austen as an author, albeit anonymously. R. W. Chapman's 1923 edition has become the standard for modern versions of the novel.</p>

          Adaptations
        </header>
        <p id="para">Numerous screen adaptations have popularized Pride and Prejudice. Notable versions include a 1940 Academy Award-winning film and the 2005 adaptation starring Keira Knightley. BBC produced television versions in 1980 and the widely acclaimed 1995 series with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. The story has also been adapted on stage, including a 1935 version by Helen Jerome and a 1995 musical concept album.</p>
        <p id="para">Pride and Prejudice has inspired various literary works, from sequels like Pemberley by Emma Tennant to modern adaptations like Bridget Jones's Diary by Helen Fielding. Seth Grahame-Smith's Pride and Prejudice and Zombies introduced a unique twist, blending Austen's work with elements of horror. Pamela Aidan's trilogy tells the story from Mr. Darcy's perspective, while Jo Baker's Longbourn explores the lives of the servants.</p>
        <p id="para">In contemporary settings, Curtis Sittenfeld's Eligible transplants the characters to modern-day Cincinnati, adding a fresh twist to the Bennet family's struggles. Fire Island, a 2022 movie, reimagines Pride and Prejudice as a gay drama set on Fire Island.</p>
        <p id="para">Beyond literature, Pride and Prejudice has inspired scientific endeavors. In 2010, a pheromone was named "darcin" after Mr. Darcy due to its attractiveness to female mice. Additionally, a scientific paper speculated about genetic diseases in the Bennet family, offering a unique perspective on the characters.</p>
